# API {#api}

Our API is at https://api.lnnodeinsight.com

Currently there are only two endpoints right now. More to come in the future!

## Centralities

This contains the centrality ranks (unweighted and capacity-weighted) for nodes that meet a (very) minimal requirement to be ranked.

## LN summary stats timeseries

This endpoint contains historical summary data about the LN going back to around March, 2021. It has the total number of channels, nodes and total capacity observed at a given historical point.
